Platform</h1>
<p>Fault-tolerant dataflow platform implementation for the distributed
systems course of the Polytechnic of Milan.</p>
<h2 id="project-description">Project Description</h2>
<p>The platform is implemented for processing key-value pairs where keys
and values are integers. The platform offers three operators, which are
executed independently and in parallel for each key <code>k</code>: -
<code>map(f: int -&gt; int)</code>: for each input tuple
<code>&lt;k, v&gt;</code>, it outputs a tuple
<code>&lt;k, f(v)&gt;</code> - <code>changeKey(f: int -&gt; int)</code>:
for each input tuple <code>&lt;k, v&gt;</code>, it outputs a tuple
<code>&lt;f(v), v&gt;</code> -
<code>reduce(f: list&lt;int&gt; -&gt; int)</code>: takes in input the
list <code>V</code> of all values for key <code>k</code>, and outputs
<code>&lt;k, f(V)&gt;</code></p>
<p>The platform includes a <strong>coordinator</strong> and multiple
<strong>workers</strong>. The coordinator accepts <strong>dataflow
programs</strong> specified as an arbitrarily long sequence of the above
operators. Programs are defined in a JSON file provided as input. Each
operator is executed in parallel over multiple partitions of the input
data, where the number of partitions is specified as part of the
dataflow program. The coordinator splits the input data among processes
and sends the operations set. Input data is split among processes based
on the key. Thanks to this approach key-value pairs with the same key
are located into the same process.</p>
<p>The systems implements a fault-tolerance mechanism that limit the
amount of work that needs to be be re-executed in the case a worker
fails. This is achieved by saving a dump file containing the partial
results computed until the failure. The coordinator keeps track of the
operations computed by each worker and then tells it the point in the
operations set it executed.</p>
<p>The project uses <a href="https://www.open-mpi.org">Open MPI</a> and
<a href="https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">mpi4py</a> as
middleware for distributed computing.</p>
